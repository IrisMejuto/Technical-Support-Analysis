## 🪟 Overview:
In this project, conducted with Power BI for the DataDNA ZoomCharts Mini Challenge, I focus on analyzing technical support data. The report includes detailed visualizations that provide insights into ticket volumes, response and resolution times, and customer satisfaction across various dimensions.

Utilizing Power BI's robust capabilities and ZoomCharts' interactive visuals, I embarked on cleaning, modeling, exploring, and visualizing the comprehensive dataset to discover critical insights.
