## 🪟 Overview:
In this project, conducted with Power BI for the DataDNA ZoomCharts Mini Challenge, I focus on analyzing technical support data. The report includes detailed visualizations that provide insights into ticket volumes, response and resolution times, and customer satisfaction across various dimensions.

Utilizing Power BI's robust capabilities and ZoomCharts' interactive visuals, I embarked on cleaning, modeling, exploring, and visualizing the comprehensive dataset to discover critical insights.

## 🗃️ Dataset:
The dataset is made up of 1 file, you can download:

## 🖇️ Model:
The data modeling stage involved creating a relational data model that reflects the relationships between Agents, Locations, Product Groups, Topics, and Tickets.

## ❓ Key questions the project answers:
* ✅ 1. What are the peak ticket creation times?
* ✅ 2. How do the first response and resolution times compare against SLAs?
* ✅ 3. What are the customer satisfaction rates across different agents and topics?
* ✅ 4. How do ticket volumes vary daily, weekly, and monthly?
* ✅ 5. How do ticket volumes compare between workdays and weekends?
* ✅ 6. What is the distribution of tickets during standard work hours versus after hours?
* ✅ 7. What trends are seen in ticket topics and their resolutions?
* ✅ 8. How do support channels (chat, phone, email) compare in terms of ticket volume and resolution?
* ✅ 9. What geographic trends exist in ticket submissions and product issues?
* ✅ 10. How quickly do tickets move through the resolution process?
